Baton Keycloak Connector - forked from github.com/spiros-spiros/baton-keycloak

Baton Keycloak Connector is a plugin that integrates Keycloak with Baton, enabling seamless synchronization and provisioning of users and groups.
üîß Features

    User & Group Synchronization: Fetches users and groups from Keycloak for Baton to manage.

    Provisioning Support: Allows Baton to create, update, and delete users and groups within Keycloak.

    Read-Only Mode: Option to operate in a non-destructive mode, preventing any changes to Keycloak data.

    Customizable Configuration: Supports various Keycloak setups through environment variables or command-line flags.
